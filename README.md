## Features

 - Simple check-in to make staying on track intuitive and effortless.


 - **Assessment Statistics**
  - Visual representation of current and past assessment scores with added metrics for clarity.

## Implementation
#### *Authentication*
PTM utilizes `react-native-oauth` to manage tokens between the GitHub API as well as the Progress Tracker Mobile API.  Opening the application initiates an automatic reconfiguring of the authorization tokens (or initial configuration) to ensure a constantly changing set of auth keys.

```ruby
componentDidMount() {
  if ( Boolean(manager.savedAccounts().accounts) ) {
    manager.deauthorize('github')
    .then( () => manager.configure( config.auth ) );
  } else {
    manager.configure( config.auth );
  }
}
```
You can also log out on the profile page to force a token reset.
